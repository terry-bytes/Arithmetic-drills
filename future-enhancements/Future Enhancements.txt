1) Add Speech Feature:

Implement a speech feature that allows the app to verbally communicate arithmetic problems and solutions to users.
Utilize text-to-speech (TTS) technology to convert written text into spoken language, enhancing accessibility and user experience.
Provide options for users to enable or disable the speech feature based on their preferences.

2) Arithmetic Operation Selection:

Enhance user customization by allowing them to choose their preferred arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) for practice drills.
Introduce a user interface element where users can select specific arithmetic operations they want to focus on during their practice sessions.
Ensure seamless integration of the selected operations into the app's algorithm for generating arithmetic problems.

3) Introduction of Difficulty Levels:

Implement a difficulty system, offering users a range of challenge levels i.e Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extreme.
Customize the difficulty levels based on factors such as problem complexity, time constraints, and the range of numbers involved.
Provide clear indicators or descriptions for each difficulty level to help users select the appropriate level based on their skill level and preference.

4) Online Competition Feature:

Introduce an online competition feature that enables users to participate in real-time arithmetic challenges against other app users.
Implement multiplayer functionality where users can compete against friends or randomly matched opponents.
Include features such as leaderboards, rankings, and rewards to enhance competitiveness and engagement among users.
Ensure robust security measures and fair gameplay mechanics to maintain the integrity of the competition.
